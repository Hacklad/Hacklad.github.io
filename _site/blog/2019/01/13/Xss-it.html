<p>I will be covering a story of a bug I found in a private program. As a result of improper access control, an organisation staff with no write permission was able to xss the Admin and owner of the organisation! Surreal, isn’t it?. Reading your mind, I guess you are asking “How”</p>

<p>Hi, I am Yusuf Yazir. Follow me as I take you through this short and pleasant journey of David and Goaliath.</p>

<h2 id="introduction">INTRODUCTION:</h2>

<p>For the sake of privacy, let’s call this website example.com. On example.com, whenever the owner of the organisation registers, he gets a subdomain similar to the name of his organisation. For example, Org name is Hacklad, we will get Hacklad.example.com. Nice name, isn’t it? :) Thanks Thanks. However, the owner could add admins, manager, staff.</p>

<h2 id="self-xss-owner">SELF XSS (OWNER)</h2>
<p>On the owner account, like most people will do, I added my XSS payload “&lt;img src=x onerror=alert(1)&gt;” when creating a project in the <em>project name</em> field. XSS popped, I smiled, grabbed a cup of water. Logged In quickly into the Admin browser(Firefox), Guess what? NO XSS on project name.. Whoops!</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>			GIF I tried creating project with Admin but sadly it was blocked! My heart started palpitating, I felt worse and disappointed!  
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="inspiration">INSPIRATION:</h2>
<p>Normally when I am in a situation like this, I go checkup some of my chats with Elite Hackers on Twitter just to get myself backup. I was scrolling through Nahamsec’s Chat and I saw this… Whooot?</p>

<h2 id="access-control">Access Control</h2>
<p>I took enough time to understand the flow of the application. Then I started creating another project with the owner, on landing on the create page I noticed the url <code class="highlighter-rouge">hacklad.example.com/add/new/project</code>. Changed my browser to where the staff is logged In, and I tried accessing this URL and suprisingly I saw a staff with no write could actually create project.. How? I don’t care.. I added my XSS payload “&lt;img src=z onerror=alert(9)&gt;” in the project field and NO XSS! Another Heartbreak! It is time to give up having in mind to submit this permission issue, I closed the staff browser and I was about closing the Admin, I decided to reload and on doing that, I saw 9, Yes XSS POPPED! WOOOOOW!</p>
